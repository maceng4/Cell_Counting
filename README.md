# Cell_Counting
Tasks to complete by 4/15/20:
- get opencv/cv2 working 
- make sure the simple blob detection function of opencv works
- ensure we can edit parameters of simple blob detection
- test simple blob detection using thalamus test image AND preprocessing steps 




-----------

Tasks to complete by 3/7
  1) create skeleton code
  2) attempt an OpenCV (cv2) framework

----------

Tasks to complete by 2/28
  1) select 2 current cell counting programs and run the above test images through them to judge their efficacy 
  2) start slack channel 
  3) come to next lab meeting with ideas of where to begin our version of the progam 
      (i.e start from scratch / start from someone else's existing code) 
  4) consider using multiple approaches for the sake of validating one method by using another
  5) consider using algorithms which approach a cell-like object, and implement PCA/K-means clustering to feature extract and classify whether it is a cell and/or if there are multiple types of cells / objects. user clicks on 20-30 items to make templates for (blood vessel) vs (flouro artifact) vs cell. Design interface that allows this.
